Automated Splunk Distributed Deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

This repository provides a fully automated solution for deploying a Splunk distributed environment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Ansible and Linux. The deployment is designed to be scalable, efficient, and easy to set up, making it ideal for managing large-scale log data and analytics workloads.

Key Features

    Automated Infrastructure Provisioning: Leverages GCP's compute and networking services to provision resources dynamically.

    Distributed Splunk Architecture: Deploys a multi-tier Splunk environment, including Search Heads, Indexers, and Forwarders, for high availability and scalability.

    Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Ansible playbooks are used to automate the configuration and deployment of Splunk components.

    Customizable and Scalable: Easily adapt the deployment to meet your organization's specific needs, whether for small-scale testing or large-scale production environments.

    Cost-Effective: Optimized for GCP to ensure efficient resource utilization and cost management.
